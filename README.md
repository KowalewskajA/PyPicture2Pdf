# PyPicture2Pdf

An interactive tool for converting pictures to pdf. It is utalizing [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)s converting feature and [QT](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) for the user interface.

It is a fast prototype that does not include all the bells and shiny features you might expect but it works.

# Requirements

You should have an python installation above 3.6 and [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) installed.

In the directory just type:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pipenv install
```

# Run PyPicture2Pdf

After the environment is created you can run the PyPicture2Pdf by typing:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pipenv run PyP2P.py
```
